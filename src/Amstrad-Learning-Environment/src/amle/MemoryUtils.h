 * 
 * The Amstrad CPC memory is 65536 (2^16) bytes long. Therefore the values passed to these 
 * functions should only be within the [0, 65535] range. 
 * 
 * To get any crucial information from the memory, the address in memory has to be known before hand.
 * Such addresses can sometimes be found online but otherwise the game has to be disassembled or raw 
 * memory outputs have to be analyzed.
