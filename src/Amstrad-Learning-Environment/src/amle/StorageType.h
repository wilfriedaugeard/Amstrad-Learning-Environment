/** \file StorageType.h
 * \brief StorageType is an enumeration representing the different possible encodings possible in the memory, especially 
 * regarding the integers. For instance, some game do NOT store all their integers as hexadecimal values corresponding to the 
 * actual decimal expected value.
 * 
 * As a concrete example, in the memory of Arkanoid may be found the current score : "32 35 38 34". This could be 
 * interpreted as being a little endian encoding : "876098866". But this would be incorrect. This is actually 
 * an ASCII encoding (probably used because it is then easy to display). So the correct way to convert it, is to 
 * get the corresponding ASCII character of each byte : "2584".
 * 
 * So far, there are two types of encoding found in the memory of games and one is expected to exist :
 * 
 * - ASCII : "32 35 38 34" = "2584". Get the ASCII value of each byte. (Ex: Arkanoid)
 * 
 * - HEX : "32 35 38 34" = "842348596". Big Endian encoding. (Never found yet)
 * 
 * - DEC : "32 35 38 34" = "32353834". Human readable encoding. (Ex: Buggy Boy)
